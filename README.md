In most real-world applications of "blind" pitch estimation, we are interested in a specific source, or we already know the instrument tags in a recording. Timbre-Aware Pitch Estimation exploits this prior information to spot the pitch of the target harmonic pattern directly from the multi-source polyphonic mixture. Many behavioral studies suggest the importance of selective attention in auditory scene analysis. [Many properties of audio can affect the stream segregation.](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/1.5065392#) However, despite being one of the most important of such properties, timbre dependency is rarely explored for pitch stream segregation and analysis.
