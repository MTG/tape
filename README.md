# Timbre-Aware Pitch Estimator

In most real-world applications of "blind" pitch estimation, we are interested in a specific source, or we already know the instrument tags in a recording. Timbre-Aware Pitch Estimation exploits this prior information to spot the target harmonic pattern directly from multi-source polyphonic mixture, without any source separation step.
